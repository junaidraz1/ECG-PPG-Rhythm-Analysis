## üìå Project Description  
This project focuses on **segmenting ECG & PPG signals, assessing signal quality, and performing rhythm analysis** to identify differences between sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation. The methods include **non-overlapping/overlapping segmentation, ensemble averaging, time interval computation, and rhythm visualization**.  

## üìÇ Features  
‚úÖ **Segment ECG & PPG signals** into 10-second windows (supports overlapping & non-overlapping)  
‚úÖ **Compute ensemble-averaged heartbeats** and visualize them  
‚úÖ **Extract key time intervals** from the ECG & PPG waveforms (T-wave & diastolic peak)  
‚úÖ **Develop a rhythm analysis metric** to differentiate sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation  
‚úÖ **Visualize rhythm differences** to support atrial fibrillation detection algorithms  

## üìù Methodology  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Signal Segmentation:**  
   - Divide signals into **10-second non-overlapping segments**  
   - Allow flexibility for **overlapping segmentation**  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Ensemble Averaging of Heartbeats:**  
   - Align detected beats from peak maxima  
   - Overlay and compute **sample-wise averaged heartbeats**  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Time Interval Computation:**  
   - Identify **T-wave from ECG**  
   - Detect **diastolic peak from PPG**  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Rhythm Analysis for Sinus Rhythm vs. Atrial Fibrillation:**  
   - Develop **a visualization/metric** to distinguish between the two rhythms  
   - Not a full detection pipeline, but a **foundation for AFib detection algorithms**  

## üìä Visualization  
- **Segmented ECG & PPG signals**  
- **Overlay of ensemble-averaged waveforms**  
- **Time intervals marked on ECG & PPG signals**  
- **Comparison of sinus rhythm vs. atrial fibrillation signals**
